# Heap (data-structure)

In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized tree-based
data structure that satisfies the heap property described
below.

In a _min heap_, if `P` is a parent node of `C`, then the
key (the value) of `P` is less than or equal to the
key of `C`.

In a _max heap_, the key of `P` is greater than or equal
to the key of `C`

The node at the "top" of the heap with no parents is
called the root node.
